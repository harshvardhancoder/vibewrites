Features in Detail
1. Admin Panel — The Control Center
The admin panel is designed to give administrators complete control over the platform’s content without needing technical expertise. Key functionalities include:

Create Blogs:
Admins can compose new blog posts using a built-in rich text editor, which supports formatting options like bold, italics, headings, lists, links, and image uploads. This allows rich, multimedia-enhanced content creation.

Edit and Update Blogs:
Existing posts can be quickly accessed and modified to keep content fresh and accurate. This includes editing text, replacing images, and updating tags or categories.

View and Manage Blog List:
Admins can view a dashboard listing all blog posts with summary details such as title, author, creation date, and status (published/draft). Bulk actions like delete or publish/unpublish are supported.

Categorization & Tagging:
Blogs can be organized by categories and tags, enabling better content discoverability and SEO optimization.

User Management (Optional):
Depending on the platform’s scope, the admin panel can also manage user roles, allowing multiple authors or editors with different access rights.

2. Database Integration (MySQL)
All blog data, including titles, content, metadata (author, date, categories), and media links, are stored in a well-structured MySQL database. This structure supports:

Efficient Data Retrieval:
Fast queries for blog lists, individual posts, and filtered views by category or tag.
